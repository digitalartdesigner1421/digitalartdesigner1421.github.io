<p>Welcome to my website! Here you can find several pieces of art such as the one on top, that I design on my computer through photoshop. These pieces include Pop Art, Self portraits, Silhouettes and more. Above this paragraph you will be able to find one of the first images that I have designed on photoshop, and it is a Pop Art of the soccer player Neymar.</p>

<p>My job is to understand what you want and the way you want it, so that you and everyone can be happy.</p>

<p>I design Artworks for that go on T-shirts, frames and more. I specialize in Silhouettes and Pop Art, because I always have inspiration around me.<p>  

<p>If you ever would like to buy my pieces of art or have me design a photo you can email me, and I will reply ASAP.</p>

</p>How this works: You will email me a photo that you want me to design or make better, for example: a photo of a person into a silhouette, or a photo of a persons face into Pop Art, Then, I will respond ASAP and I will start working as soon as I get the photograph.</p>

<p>When I am finished I can either frame it, print it on a shirt that you like, or do what you desire. After that, I will email you the final price with the photograph with my watermark on it and we will discuss if you like the final photograph. I will have a paypal account set up so that you can pay safely. I am a honest and loyal person who is happy to help anyone who wants some art! When you are ready to pay, you can pay with your PayPal through the PayPal website when you click the button under the last image.</p>

<p>The amount of money I charge all depends on the time that it takes for me to use it and the materials that I use, so I charge less for the less time absorbing artworks and more for the one that absorb more time. I usually charge $15-$20 for images that go on shirts and I charge $10-$15 for framed items. Thank you for visiting this website and I hope you enjoy your day.</p>
